## 🚀 Overview

NanoCloud was born out of a personal need for a lightweight, high-performance file management solution. It serves two primary purposes:

### 📂 Network Dropbox
A minimal, self-hosted alternative to Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox.
* **Localized Speed:** Utilize the full bandwidth of your LAN for uploads and downloads, completely bypassing your ISP.
* **Universal Access:** Files uploaded from one device are immediately available to stream or download from any other device on your network.
* **No External Dependencies:** Your data stays within your local environment, ensuring privacy and high-speed performance.

### 📸 Seamless File Sharing
Designed to solve the "How do I send you these photos?" problem.
* **Guest-Friendly:** A dead-simple interface that allows non-technical guests to share or receive files without needing accounts or complex setups.
* **Zero Friction:** Perfect for quick transfers of photos and videos during gatherings or events.

## ⚠️ Security & Caution

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This application is designed for trusted private networks only.**

* **Trust Model:** This tool operates on the assumption that all users on your local network are trusted. **No native authentication or user access control is implemented.**
* **Deployment:** **Do not deploy this on a publicly accessible server/internet.** Anyone with the URL will have at least read access to your files.
* **Hardening:** If you require security, you can implement authentication (such as Basic Auth or Authelia) via your web server (Nginx, Apache, Caddy, etc.) acting as a reverse proxy.

## ⚙️ Configuration

NanoCloud uses a flexible configuration system. Create `config/local.php` to customize:

```php
<?php
// Storage location
$STORAGE_ROOT = '/path/to/storage';

// Download rate limiting
$DOWNLOAD_RATE_LIMIT_MB = 10; // MB/s (0 = unlimited)

// File permissions
$DIR_PERMISSIONS = 0755;
$FILE_PERMISSIONS = 0644;

// Chunked upload configuration
$CHUNK_TEMP_DIR = sys_get_temp_dir() . '/nanocloud-chunks';
$CHUNK_STALE_HOURS = 2; // Hours to keep incomplete uploads

// Operation control
$READ_ONLY = false;
$UPLOAD_ENABLED = true;
$DELETE_ENABLED = true;
$RENAME_ENABLED = true;
$MOVE_ENABLED = true;
```

### Chunked Uploads

NanoCloud automatically uses chunked uploads for files larger than 2MB, enabling:
- **Unlimited file sizes** (bypasses PHP upload limits)
- **Resumable uploads** across devices and sessions
- **Automatic retry** on network failures
- **Cross-device resume** - start on desktop, continue on mobile

**Configuration:**
- `CHUNK_TEMP_DIR`: Where to store temporary chunks (default: system temp)
- `CHUNK_STALE_HOURS`: Hours to keep incomplete uploads (default: 2)

> 📖 **Chunked upload details:** See [Chunked Upload Guide](docs/CHUNKED_UPLOAD.md)

> 📖 **Full configuration options:** See [Configuration Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)

## 🏗️ Architecture

NanoCloud follows modern software architecture principles with clean separation of concerns:

### Backend Architecture

**Request Flow:**
```
Browser → public/api.php → Security Layer → Service Layer → Response
```

**Key Components:**

- **Core Layer**: Configuration, Request/Response handling
- **Security Layer**: Path validation, input sanitization
- **Service Layer**: Business logic (Directory, File, Upload, Storage services)
- **Helpers**: Shared utility functions
